    <title>Webpack Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        This example came from http://www.edc4it.com/blog/web/webpack-tutorial.html.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, there is no longer any script include element!
        Instead webpack knows to add it for you automagically.

    <p>
        Summary of changes from previous module.
        <ul>
            <li>Removed &gt;script&lt; element from html file.</li>
            <li>Modified the webpack.config.js file so that it auto injects the name of the main bundle</li>
            <li>Modified the package.json file to add <b>npm run watch</b> command</li>
            <li>Installed the webpack-dev-server so changes are auto refreshed.</li>
        </ul>
