        This example came from <a href="http://www.edc4it.com/blog/web/webpack-tutorial.html">http://www.edc4it.com/blog/web/webpack-tutorial.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, there is no longer any script include element!
        Instead webpack knows to add it for you automagically.
