# Webpack example with React-Bootstrap

This example is really just a normal React example where
react is using some other packages.  Nothing special with regards to 
Webpack.

## Running this example

This example uses webpack-dev-server to host the runtime environment
to server the single page application.

    npm start
    
This example uses HMR (Hot Module Reloading) so the code can be
changed and is automatically transpiled and updated.
