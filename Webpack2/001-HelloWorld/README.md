# Webpack Basics
This sample came from the Webpack documentation page http://www.edc4it.com/blog/web/webpack-tutorial.html
I'm not going to duplicate the terrific writeup that was done there so
just go read that.

Note the first three directories 
- 001-HelloWorld
- 002-HelloWorld
- 003-HelloWorld

were all created when I followed the above webpage.

## Running this example
Open a shell and type the command

    webpack
    
This should generate the directory and files:

dist/bundle.js
dist/index.html

Open your browser to dist/index.html and you should see the contents
of the file "contents.js".

Read the website for more details.
