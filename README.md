# Webpack-Learning

I have different sub-directories for each version of webpack that
I've had to learn.

Each directory has a README.md that will more fully explain
what is in that directory.

## Links to sub-projects
Below are links to the sub-projects assuming that

    ./scripts/start-web-server
    
has been run in the top-level directory for this git project.
basically if the above command works, then your in the right directory.
If your on windows you need to use: ```.\scripts\start-web-server```  

## This project was written for me/my use 
This project was written for me and my use so it might not be
fully finished or as well documented as you (or I) might like.

## To use it
- Start the web server.
- Pick one of the projects (they should each be stand alone) and run

    npm install
    npm run package

The package command should create the bundle or whatever is needed
so that the examples could run.
